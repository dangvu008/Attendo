# TypeScript Migration Plan

This document outlines the plan for migrating the Workly app from JavaScript to TypeScript.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current)
- [x] Set up TypeScript configuration
- [x] Update build configuration
- [x] Create type definitions for i18n

### Phase 2: i18n System
- [x] Migrate i18n/i18n.js to TypeScript
- [x] Migrate i18n/useTranslation.js to TypeScript
- [x] Migrate i18n/Trans.js to TypeScript
- [ ] Create type-safe interfaces for translations

### Phase 3: Context and Hooks
- [ ] Migrate context/AppContext.js to TypeScript
- [ ] Migrate context/ThemeContext.js to TypeScript
- [ ] Migrate custom hooks to TypeScript

### Phase 4: Components
- [ ] Migrate core UI components to TypeScript
- [ ] Migrate screen components to TypeScript
- [ ] Update component props with proper interfaces

### Phase 5: Utilities and Constants
- [ ] Migrate utility functions to TypeScript
- [ ] Migrate constants to TypeScript

## Migration Guidelines

When migrating a file from JavaScript to TypeScript:

1. Rename the file extension from `.js` to `.tsx` for React components or `.ts` for non-React files
2. Add type annotations for function parameters and return values
3. Create interfaces for component props
4. Add proper type annotations for state variables
5. Fix any type errors that arise
6. Update imports in other files if necessary

## Testing Strategy

After migrating each file:

1. Run TypeScript compiler to check for type errors
2. Run unit tests to ensure functionality is preserved
3. Test the component in the app to verify visual appearance and behavior

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during migration:

1. Revert the file to its JavaScript version
2. Document the issues encountered
3. Create a plan to address the issues before attempting migration again
